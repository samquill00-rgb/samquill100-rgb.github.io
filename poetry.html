<blockquote>
  <p>
      Hey Ho The White Swan By God I Am Thy Man <em> is a culturally rich, beautifully furnished suite of poetry which recalls grand literary eccentrics like Beckett, Joyce and Gertrude Stein. Through classical scenes and moments of devilish intensity, Sam Quill writes with rare elegance and grace, in expectation of “the plants his ashes sow in heaven.”
    </em>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>
      These beautiful poems do the most important thing — they risk something. There is something heroic about Quill’s utterly shameless love of language, brimming over, daring you to say that you’ve had your fill. Greedy in the best possible sense; for life, observed, pinned, transfigured and remade.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>— <strong>Keiran Goddard</strong>, <em>Votive, I See Buildings Fall Like Lightning</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>
      There was someone else I was getting excited about… Sam Quill. In the <em>PN Review</em>, he had 14 sonnets that are quite remarkable. He lives in South London and apparently these sonnets were his first in print which is exciting.
    </em>
